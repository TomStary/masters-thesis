This master's thesis aims to design and implement an object-graph mapper library for the .NET framework.
The two primary goals for the library are the ability to map objects to the database and the ability to map queries from LINQ to Cypher queries and their result to the object.
Based on the analysis of the graph database, Entity Framework and the similar solutions, the design for the library was decided.
The library is implemented in \CS as proof-of-concept with limited functionality, and the source code is available on GitHub.
At the end of the thesis, the implementation is evaluated, and the next steps for development are proposed.
