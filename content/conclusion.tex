\begin{conclusion}

    This thesis aimed to design and create a proof-of-concept for the library for the .NET that would be able to map objects into graphs and vice versa with the ability to execute queries on the Neo4j graph database.

    At the begging of this thesis, we studied graph databases, their properties and their differences from the relational databases.
    We also studied the \CS\ language and .NET to understand how the LINQ library works.

    Understanding both the language and the database system, we looked into similar solutions. The first one was the Entity Framework, which is the \acrshort{orm} library for the .NET.
    The second was the Neo4j-\acrshort{ogm} library for the Java.

    Having studied both technologies and existing solutions, we defined our goals for the library's design.
    Based on these goals, we created a design for our library.

    Using the design we created, we implemented a proof-of-concept for the library.
    The proof-of-concept has been tested using \acrshort{tdd} principles.
    This library has limited functionality, but it proves the possibility of the translation between LINQ and Cypher queries.
    At the end of the implementation, we prepared our project for release by setting up GitHub actions providing us with the \acrshort{cicd} capabilities.

    At last, we evaluated our solution, which met all the proposed goals of implementing the proof-of-concept.
    However, we pointed out the oversights in our design and proposed the next steps for the library.
    With these steps implemented, the library should be ready for use in the production environment.
